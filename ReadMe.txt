ChemLook
===========
<http://github.com/ghutchis/chemlook/>

This is a Quick Look plugin that renders chemistry files using the Open Babel library:
<http://openbabel.org/>

To install the plugin, just drag it to /Library/QuickLook or ~/Library/QuickLook.
You may need to create that folder if it doesn't already exist.

The plugin is also installed by default with the related ChemSpotlight plugin, which indexes chemistry files using Open Babel and adds chemical metadata (molecular mass, formula, etc.) to the Finder.

Thanks to Nate Gray (http://n8gray.org/) for his QLColorCode plugin for colorizing source code. I used this as a model for communicating with WebKit and command-line programs.

Thanks also to iChemLabs for their excellent JavaScript ChemDoodle Web components. These are used to generate the interactive QuickLook HTML views.
